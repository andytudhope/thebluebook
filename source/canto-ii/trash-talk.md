# Trash Talk

There's more trash every time
I go down to this deserted beach,
served up by a wild sea
so that were I here ten thousand years,
still, it would not get picked up.

How wonderful!

Never-ending opportunities
to bend and touch sand,
bow on the rising earth
and carry back humankind's
marvelous folly.

What grace!

So many unknowing poets,
ignorant and illuminated:
plastic dancers caught in
a drama about a dying race
and what gets buried with our dead.

All perfect!

The bottle top and sea urchin,
both green dots orphaned
on this endless shore,
sure, absolutely sure,
of nothing.
