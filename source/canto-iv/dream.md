# Dream

Hand in hand, 
they walk the afternoon,
and I watch you greet as old friends
the people of a poetry so narrow -
just a straight conduit 
between birth and death -
beings right between 
the born and the made,
people of the stars 
come to bury their dead
in the Cradle, 
to guard over 
the many masks of god, 
with an amazing gift 
for naked communication.

And you, dreamer, 
who sang the sun’s flight, 
who watched melancholic
as clouds covered its ascent
and then - bathed in awe 
that felt like music, that smelled 
like jasmine and beetroot - 
a world suffused 
in a joker’s play on pink
as if sunset were just another way 
of breathing out, 
beginning again,
but this time with a people
who walk the ledges, the layers, 
the liminal space in songs of suffering
that bubble up like fragrant undertows,
all of us adrift on a dream designed
to discover the kind of love 
that could even conceive 
of singing the sun's flight,
of holding happiness right here.
Eternity not in the palm,

but between, as it began: 
hand in hand.
