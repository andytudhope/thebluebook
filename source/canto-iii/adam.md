# Adam

Here's the story of a man
so gripped by death
he came back to live it
ten thousand times and more.

Ten thousand lives
with so much love
and so much longing
that it all melted
in the lines of repetition.

Simple lines about empty
hills and how they sing
when the wind blows
just right.

Right here 
where your heart beats,
over and over,
the most obvious thing
repeated patiently.
