# Wonder

To walk this world forever, 
forever a wandering heart, 
hearing all the old stories 
about how beauty will save the world, 
how truth will set you free, 
and know that there is no difference
between freedom and being bound
to come back here,
again and again, a process,
a pilgrim on a journey through time, 
no purpose per se,
other than rhythm
and all its sister words,
like revelry and redemption
and revelation and rejoice
as if your voice were an instrument
of eternity itself, echoing
through the ages to come,
long after your entangled shadows 
of infinity and nothingness
have faded again:
a dancing speck of dust
suspended in a star beam,
a stream of past flowing 
forever in this emptiness.
