# Ikkyu

Entrust yourself to the windblown clouds
and do not wish to live forever.
There is no decoration up there,
just a clear moon and emptiness.

Emptiness!

Love this passing nothing
like water, which so yearns 
to join again what it came from
that it has learnt to float,
split the old sunset
into ten thousand new colours.
