# Limits

It's possible to turn a balcony
into a spaceship
and travel time with a tree tapping
in the coordinates for hyperdrive.

I don't say this to be funny,
though it is,
like a joke I heard about god,
spiders and butt rope.

I mean it very literally,
so simple
that the funny reading
is by far the most accurate.

No hidden gems here, 
just this,
and ten thousand other rude ways
to talk about the same silk.
