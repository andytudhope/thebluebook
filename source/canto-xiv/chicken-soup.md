# Chicken Soup

I made it in a week, while walking
the random ways
between,
slurping chicken soup for a soul.

This long song,
made by my mom,
had somehow within it 
all the worry I caused her.

Still an enraptured rhythm 
devoted to re-membering,
and then remembering re-membering:

>"The first is ours, the second is of God"
