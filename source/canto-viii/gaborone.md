# Gaborone

The flags hang soft against
a quiet summer morning, 
sweat already mixed with a strange scent,
not smog but spring, my nose 
overjoyed at the sensation of smelling
what a fresh sunrise means,
after last night's storm 
washed the boundless sky,
blue and blue and blue forever, 
further than you
can see or imagine.

Smell holds deeper memory still:
wafting through an old piece of music 
about dreamers who live
the stories you sensed once,
lying next to me, 
asking what it was to make a life
beneath the thing you love, 
forever.

I gathered your face in my hands 
and kissed you
and said, _just like this_,
whispering the secret 
against your neck
in a language you cannot hear 
because it is made from breath 
and heat and the play of lips on skin.

It is the vacant blue itself 
which soaks our soul and - 
written in the few clouds 
whipped across it -
is the only thing worth being.
