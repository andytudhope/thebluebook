# Program Me

For this variable i - 
     still caught in loops
          he can't quite write out, led back to infinity
          every time he tries to run
     a program meant to prove how funny fate can be - 
there is no escape.

/** There is just a random walk ahead
through the vast desert, a monad
destined for the illuminated dark,
a kind of dream that can only point
to a loop held open by the infinitesimal
eternity between. **/

The program doesn't work, of course,
     such a joke can't be stored in memory
          leaving me trying to echo the results
          in the hope that you will see i change,
     but all that shows is the same blank page:
vast emptiness, nothing sacred.

/** No loops, no variables, no fate.
Where, then, does the laughter come from? **/
