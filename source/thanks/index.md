# A Vote of Thanks

But special thanks to Mohamed Bulbulia for teaching more than can ever be said with words, and to Stefan and Candella for the most amazing tango I have had the privilege of witnessing. To Tamara Hauvuy, Raffaela Napoli, Kai Edwards, Lucie Sarati, Ricky Thomas, Marc Coppin, Ben Robinson, Dominique Wiggill, Lize Steyn, Peter Hayward, Michal Shachman, the whole ChainSafe team and the rest of Camp 404 who helped get us all properly lost in a desert.
