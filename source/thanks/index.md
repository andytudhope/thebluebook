# A Vote of Thanks

Digital thanks for a digital-native book have been done [here](https://twitter.com/cryptowanderer/status/1151778816416768003).

However, it also appropriate to thank the flesh-and-blood heart-people so intimately involved in the crafting of this work.

**And a whole culture to educate them**: to all my wonderful teachers at [St. Peter's](https://www.stpeters.co.za/uploads/boys_files/St_Peters_School_Values_-_LARGER_FONT.pdf) for the thirteen formative years I spent there.

A special vote of thanks to both Emma Jackson and JJ van der Vyver, who continue to lead me through some of the most interesting thoughts long after we left school.

**Vis, vertus, veritas**: All Rhodes lead to Paul Walters, Deborah Seddon, Minesh Das, Jamie MacGregor, Sam Naidu, Mike and Sue Marais, Dan Wylie, Ray Haggard, David Roux, Anthony Sullivan, Joey Medved and the many other lecturers who honed my mind in Grahamstown.

A special vote of thanks, though, to the whole English Honours Class of 2013 - literally the best class I have ever had the privilege in which to participate.

Also, my undying thanks to Harry Owen - the man most responsible for teaching me a love of poetry - and the whole Cycle of Knowledge who gathered in Grahamstown, including Ulizwi Mvuyisi and Thembani Ma'at Onceya.

**Dominus illuminatio mea**: Michelle Kelly, Nadia Khamis, Martin Larke, Ben Hamer, Peter Finnerty III, Peter Fiske; Tim, Mel, Prachi, Ruth, Fred, Stephanie, John, and the rest of another amazing English class in Oxford. My eternal thanks also to Barbara Gerber for bringing me back from some of the more abstract thoughts I found myself entangled in on returning to African soils.

**Now the dance**: which is mostly digital. But special thanks to Mohamed Bulbulia for teaching me more than can ever be said with words, and to Stefan and Candella for the most amazing tango I have ever had the privilege of witnessing. To Tamara Hauvuy, Raffaela Napoli, Kai Edwards, Lucie Sarati and Dominique Wiggill for dancing in a forest with me; and Ricky Thomas, Marc Coppin, Ben Robinson, Lize Steyn, Peter Hayward, Michal Shachman, the whole ChainSafe team and the rest of Camp 404 who helped get us all properly lost in a desert.

And, finally, to **the mindset**, who helped me validate in very wild and practical reality some of the deeper ideas in this book: Kassie Paschke, Nick du Preez, Armelle Duivesart, Jordan-Laine Calder, Nicola Lazenby, Anna Sevel, Vicky Smith, Keith Rasmussen, Jean Goodall, Shane Eades, and Jayden De Wet.

One last, honourable mention to Gauthier Amedro: a gentle and brilliant soul if ever there was one. _Salut Gaulois!_
