# The No-Boundary Condition

> "A well-constructed model creates a reality of its own" - Stephen Hawking

The way we arrange internal space
selects everything from weight and mass,
to the wavelength of visible light,
to the explosions of stars 
and the decay of all order 
bar that caught up in life, this thing
from which we draw the numbers,
we many-masked presenters 
before a make-believe audience
laughing at the wrong cues,
all caught up in a curved string,
curled so tightly that seven of its sides
slide away from view 
into a non-existent Ã¦ther, 
left floating through the mind
whether you look at it or not.

So we sum over infinite histories
and imagine, in different planes, 
the asymptotic freedom of quarks,
utterly astonished that particles
which are no more and no less
than simple patterns of vibration
could have led us here, now,
this always-present time.

Itself just another way 
of expressing space,
as if to speak of it 
were to make one dream,
one dance, one darting probe into
the eternities of emptiness
all around.
