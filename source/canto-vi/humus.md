# Humus

Words, well used, have the air
of sacrifice about them.
It sticks to the spaces between
when you understand
what I have given up
of my truth
to come here, to try and share
what it has been to know
this obliteration
and the beauty brought with it.

Yes, keep searching
for everything beautiful
and you will eventually become it,
but you must come to know us,
dreamers of the first dreams,
a species of amnesiacs
trying to find out who we were
before we awakened.

And poetry just another way
to watch well, to wait well
for what must come next,
for every crime and tender kindness,
that - like the heart's gravity - 
goes on echoing through time,
a quiet bell in the Karoo night
as the herd wanders home,
lost in star-strewn wonder.
