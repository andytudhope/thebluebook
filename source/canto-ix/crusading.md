# Crusading

There is a clearing
where Jerusalem is constructed,
its source code scribbled on a wall,
once used for wailing,
waitingâ€¦

Crossed out and accused
by an unseeing soldier
for the right case and
correct phrase.

Before we came home,
and pled for forgiveness,
willing what wafts between
remembrance and all we lost;

the roar itself
just an ambigram
for this rhythm outside time.

Travel with me back down
to dance, to be daft,
to tell you what you
already know:

The horns were hung above
our door some time ago, _Numzaan_,
and we are all most welcome
here.
