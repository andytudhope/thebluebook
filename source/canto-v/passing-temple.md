# Passing Temple

You lean down to smell an iceberg 
and tell of the transience 
of our most vivid experiences.

We evaporate, you say, 
breathe ourselves out and away, 
like perfume loosed at our shadow crossing 
where, startled still by sweetness,
you built a temple inside my hearing,
an old place I can come to pray, to be
with the untranslatable heart:

_Gesang ist Dasein_

hear, in your pulse the drumroll
that has gone before 
to come again: 
dream-life born of spent 
aged things made anew
in the tremendous silence 
between beats.

A blue song rebounds 
in caves bored deep
beneath the mountain, 
leading to dead-ends
and secret places alike 
where a fool formed a clock 
from forgotten trash,
a piece of great and objectless longing
lying in wait
for the next big shift to strike
the rubbish in a rhythm unknown,
as if we were a single beat
flung into brightness.
