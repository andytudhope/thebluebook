# Search Me

I've spent all this time searching
for a perfect metaphor for the sea,
somewhere between symphonic and surreal
without once approaching it
and asking with my feet what names
it has given to itself 
in the years it has been watched,
what words have risen by themselves
from all the countless waves and why
it is that my heart seems as wide
as the deep blue sky when I wait well
for an answer.

Water has so much to say about
the grandeur of the grounded.
Between all the grinding thoughts
like windswept white foam,
still it calls to life and glories 
in the ordinariness of it all.
