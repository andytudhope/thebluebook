# Background Life

Take note 
of the music that makes
you hollow, an outline 
in the starry night
that winds you between 
the bright past,
a thin and tattered veil
caught on points by which we map
what's real and pretend
like we know where to go from 
here.

That was always the point, 
the wandering, the random walk, 
the wayward,
guardian of a path no-one can take,
no song can sing 
bar the music that lights 
your hollow heart
as if it were the Dog Star 
come with love
to guide you back, burning,
from way beyond the sea.

Through what dreams you'll waft,
walker of the misty edge 
with but one wish
when the time finally comes 
to wake up:
bury this heart with a _tambotieboom_
and drift like ash over the sun.

Always the music 
in a background drone,
as if something old and dead 
and about to live again
were, for a moment,
smiling.
