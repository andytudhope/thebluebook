# Timing

The old crooner walks down a quay
focussed on fireworks across the bay
that illuminate an old steeple,
while the young girl dances 
between his legs and runs down 
to the rocky ocean searching
for an octopus in the pulsing night,
watching, mesmerized, 
as a toy submarine floats past,
lighting up silk-dark water and 
all the fish in such a way they seem 
more like starlight than scales.

I know these two well, 
have seen them with me everywhere, 
in meadows, churches, quiet garden lots; 
places where the sky goes on indefinitely, 
or where the seas meet and twirl 
a whitewind tango way out past forever;
places where there is no sky at all, 
just darkness and the hint 
of an ancient elephant before whom
Naledi gathered to bury her dead.

Before whom I fell last night 
and scraped my knee,
crying out softly in dream 
as I discovered not blood, 
but the light beneath,  
singing softly between shining points
as if it were not self but process,
and skin but a symbol,
a no-boundary condition 
where dance the ten thousand cells 
of a passing soul;
just another name 
for the meeting place 
of what is alone 
with what is forever:
a dance, a joke, 
a well-timed full stop.
