# Jates

I don't know what poetry is 
if not words left behind 
for the people you love, 
to guide them back
to the places we will be from, 
those old places you showed us 
beneath endless stars
and so many neighbouring eternities,
as if we all belonged to each other 
in some boundless and beckoning uncertainty,
something you can only sense on this beach
as I walk out into the cold water 
and let a bloom float away for you, 
old friend, a lily for remembering
when your great heart burst into light,
broke to beat no more and beat forever 
on further shores than thought can find,
where barefoot seekers dance 
for sand mussels where you showed us,
right between the tides and 
all this time.
