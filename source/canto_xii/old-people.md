# Old People

There is a forgotten family
of the forest who breathe in 
rising columns from ancient trees;
a people of green secrets 
who move through darkness, 
who dance what it means,
leave it broken in a bathtub 
beneath the stars,
wood and water and 
the waning moonlight
as you come once more 
to walk with me.

All around this incandescence 
like some old truth in motion,
as if order really mattered...

just truth,
                     emotion,
and these quiet people of the trees
with their endless exploration of what is
outside ourselves, 
knowing just as well
those pathless woods within,
and the wonders of our soul.
