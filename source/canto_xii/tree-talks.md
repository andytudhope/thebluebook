# Tree Talks

Poetry is language against which 
we have no defense;
it is a patterned intensity of words 
that overflows, 
fills beyond bursting 
the insignificant dams we build 
to hold ourselves back 
from being boundless,
forgetting that our bodies bind water 
in microscopic rainbows 
as a means of passing music
between rivers and streams,
all of life a trickle, laughing its way
between sudden falls,
and we, acoustic ecologists, 
sent here to preserve
the sound of our secret 
and all it has to say about
how unwanting souls 
see what is hidden;
what is not here, 
or does not feel like it...

Until it does,
until the poem is just 
your own voice
reminding you 
of the only thing you can do,
the only life you can save
and why we should talk with trees:

they answer back, 
once you let go
of what words sound like.
