# Moth Light

A moth touched my arm lightly
just now
as it fluttered past,
like a poem but traceless,
without thought or feeling, just
a fleeting moment 
of what the world could be like
if you would remember
the key needed to decrypt
this dancing flash of wings
and find again the promise 
that, if you keep searching
for everything beautiful,
you will eventually 
become it.
