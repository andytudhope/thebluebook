# Who Are You?

Who sat at the fire,
lighthouse of a living race,
and watched the world tumble
all about them.

Who came from a cut in Morningside
in the middle of August
and wandered from Egoli
to the Wild Coast for love.

Who found a way to forgive 
himself for the role she played,
figured out how to give
his whole heart back.

Who could not kill the dream,
for it seemed, somehow,
more dramatic
than another dance with death.

Who traced herself through time
to a tune made up of every human 
name until she grew tired,
humming the remainder into his heart.

Who heard a lullaby for travelers
from a war-torn place
once called home,
and raised hell for the chance to atone.

Who sat with an old friend now found,
strumming Eddie Vedder to some sticks
destined for flame
and cried their heart to this desert sky.

Who looked that lion in the eye,
and knew complete terror:
tied up, trembling, still bound
to tell it all.
