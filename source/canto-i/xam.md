# //Xam

Through all the signs, still 
at sunset 
that old temple comes back, 
a word that trips off the tongue 
with such truth 
it took years just to learn 
how to say it.  

Let alone invite back 
an old spirit wearing a desert 
for his skin, and set free the souls 
in this carved and tangled loop, 
open to our stars.  

Long ago, I lay there, 
on the platform looking up, 
and now I sit in silence 
on the rocky sand, 
my eyes closed, still before 
the million sparks swirling 
in a changing wind, 
watching raw blue fire form 
one last fugue to the forgettable, 
unforgotten people, 
waiting for their old moon 
to sing the music of flames 
and fly forever across 
the Great Face they so love, 
fierce guardians of a grace 
that was given here, 
hundreds of years after 
we finally came home.
