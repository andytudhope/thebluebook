# Iqra'

Gӧdel proved maths self-conscious
by virtue of a strange loop
drawn from both dread and dream,
a drama drafted by a quiet stream
stretching for its own blue soul.

The man showed how meaningless
symbols can swim together into a self
that stands before me,
stumbling back to a secret river
to tell the wind what was discovered
long ago, and now, again:

a golden thread
drawn from the senseless surface
sought out by sunlight
and made, built, bowed before
by me; just bonded water
that has learnt to wait well,
see its own reflection
in the most inanimate of scenes.
