# Smallness

I don't want to write a great poem.
I'm happiest in small lines, 
simple things,
that tell in as few words as possible
what it felt like to die while breathing;
what it meant to drive into the moon
through fields of white gold, 
silence singing with wind 
as sunset colour sent blue 
in pursuit of tomorrow.

Tiny words not meant 
to capture nor contain,
just to point 
at the fullness of twilight; 
the quiet, repeating 
perfection of another day
lived well.
