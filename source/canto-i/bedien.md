# Bedien

Without this Earth's dust
the early moon rise
would lack its rawness,
its red reality that reminds me
of the Afrikaans prayer
I picked up on the beach
this afternoon, expecting trash
before being taught again
about all the ways we are
connected, caught reflecting
in a gravity pool, ground down
to simple grains by grace,
and what grows even
in the tongue used to divide
our blood-lined histories.

The _dīn_ has come back,
transaction translated in action
to repeat those old words
and show how _dīn_ and _dien_
both serve the same meaning,
the same deep moonlight,
an endless music we didn't make up:
the old chords, a sacred key,
a strange pitch playing out at sea.

Our place just to witness
how Xanadu has seven garages
in this town of coral trees
and fig creepers,
all the silly signs of a singer
not at all concerned
with being found out,
fumbling in the moonlight
with a bowl of day-old cauliflower
carried to another dinner
with our kin.

[The actual prayer](https://pinterest.com/pin/536561743079480402/) I thought was trash.

["Dīn"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Din_(Arabic "meaning (Arabic)"). "Dien" means "serve" in Afrikaans.
