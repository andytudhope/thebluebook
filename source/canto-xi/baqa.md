## Baqāʾ

A simple song for the soul,
set free at Sandy Bay
as the sun set and a new moon
rose in soft rhythm,
time untangled by a sweet return
to now, here,
this windy dune dancing
in the dying light.

Love and peace
found in a happy fall,
the black gates crumbling
before this fool’s hope
for courage and goodness,
for the kind of kindness
formed in families so close
it repeats itself forever,
far past the travelling light
of our distant stars:
the perfect emptiness
of god gracing
these ever-shifting sands.
