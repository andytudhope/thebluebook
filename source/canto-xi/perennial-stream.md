## Perennial Stream 

Growing up, there were two
pissing manicans by our front door,
perpetually filling the fountain
as it fell into a long pool
with a lion fixed to a wall
at the far end, spouting forth
another stream before the drain
and filter system my dad
tried to teach me about,
wayward as I then was.

Though no cup
can ever be more full than yours,
_ṣallā Allāhu ʿalayhi wa-ʿala āli-hi wa-sallam_,
those two small boys
wetting my childhood dreams
will always overflow.
